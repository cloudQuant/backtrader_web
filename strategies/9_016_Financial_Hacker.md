This is a prompt file in Chinese for generating quantitative trading strategy documentation from HTML files. It's a template that instructs an AI to read an HTML file from a specific path (`/home/yun/Downloads/论文/论文/016_Financial Hacker.html`) and generate a comprehensive Markdown strategy document.

The prompt specifies:

**Input File:**
- HTML path: `/home/yun/Downloads/论文/论文/016_Financial Hacker.html`

**Required Output:**
A detailed Markdown document with 10 sections:
1. Title (H1)
2. Strategy Overview (H2)
3. Strategy Logic (H2)
4. Required Data (H2)
5. Why the Strategy Works (H2)
6. Risks and Considerations (H2)
7. Implementation Steps (H2)
8. Parameter Configuration (H2)
9. Backtrader Implementation Framework (H2)
10. Reference Links (H2)

**Strategy Categories:**
It also includes a classification system for strategy types (momentum, mean reversion, breakout, machine learning/AI, options, volatility, statistical arbitrage, portfolio optimization, risk management, earnings forecasts, comprehensive strategies, and others).

**Current Status:**
The HTML content shown in the file is from Financial Hacker and appears to be about "A Better Stock Rotation System" - a stock rotation strategy that aims to beat stock indices through better selection and timing methods.

Would you like me to:
1. Read the actual HTML file from the Downloads folder?
2. Help generate the strategy documentation based on this prompt?
3. Something else?
