"""Stop Loss Order Strategy Test Case.

This module tests the stop loss order functionality using convertible bond index
data (bond_index_000000.csv). It demonstrates a complete trading strategy that
uses moving average crossovers for entry signals and automatic stop loss orders
for risk management.

Strategy Overview:
    - Uses dual moving average crossover (5-day and 20-day) to generate buy signals
    - Automatically places stop loss sell orders after each buy execution
    - Stop loss price is set to 3% below the buy price
    - Monitors for death cross signals to manually close positions before stop loss
    - Tracks and reports trade statistics

Data Requirements:
    - Convertible bond index data file: bond_index_000000.csv
    - Required columns: datetime, open, high, low, close, volume
    - Optional columns: pure_bond_value, convert_value, pure_bond_premium_rate,
      convert_premium_rate

Test Assertions:
    - Processes exactly 4414 bars
    - Executes 4 buy orders
    - Executes 1 manual sell order (death cross exit)
    - Triggers 3 stop loss orders
    - Total of 5 completed trades
    - Specific performance metrics (sharpe ratio, annual return, max drawdown, final value)

Usage:
    Run as standalone script::

        python tests/strategies/05_stop_order_strategy.py

    Or use pytest::

        pytest tests/strategies/05_stop_order_strategy.py -v

def test_stop_order_strategy():
    """Test stop loss order strategy with convertible bond index data.

    This test function runs a complete backtest of the StopOrderStrategy using
    historical convertible bond index data (bond_index_000000.csv). It verifies
    strategy behavior and performance metrics against expected values.

    Test Configuration:
        - Initial cash: 100,000
        - Commission: 0.1% per trade
        - Short MA period: 5 bars
        - Long MA period: 20 bars
        - Stop loss percentage: 3%

    Expected Results:
        - Bars processed: 4414
        - Buy orders: 4
        - Manual sells (death cross): 1
        - Stop loss triggers: 3
        - Total trades: 5
        - Sharpe ratio: -0.11532400124757156
        - Annual return: -2.59%
        - Max drawdown: 75.24%
        - Final portfolio value: 62,969.16

    Analyzers Added:
        - TotalValue: Tracks portfolio value over time
        - SharpeRatio: Calculates risk-adjusted return metric
        - Returns: Calculates annualized return
        - DrawDown: Tracks maximum drawdown from peak
        - TradeAnalyzer: Provides detailed trade statistics

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any of the expected values do not match within
            the specified tolerance (1e-6 for most metrics, 0.01 for final_value).
        FileNotFoundError: If the data file 'bond_index_000000.csv' cannot be found.

    Note:
        The test uses exact value assertions to ensure strategy behavior remains
        consistent. If the data file or strategy logic changes, these expected
        values may need to be updated.
