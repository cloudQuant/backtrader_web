"""Test module for Keltner Channel trading strategy.

This module implements and tests a trading strategy based on the Keltner Channel
indicator, a volatility-based technical analysis tool developed by Chester Keltner
in 1960 and later modified by Linda Raschke. The channel consists of three lines:
a middle line (typically an EMA) and upper/lower bands based on Average True Range (ATR).

Keltner Channel Overview:
    - Middle Line: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of price
    - Upper Band: EMA + (ATR × multiplier)
    - Lower Band: EMA - (ATR × multiplier)
    - Bands expand and contract based on volatility (ATR)

Trading Application:
    - Price above upper band: Strong bullish momentum (potential breakout)
    - Price below lower band: Strong bearish momentum (potential breakdown)
    - Price between bands: Normal trading range
    - Band width indicates volatility: Wide bands = high volatility, narrow = low

Unlike Bollinger Bands which use standard deviation, Keltner Channels use ATR,
making them more responsive to price changes and gap moves. The indicator is
particularly effective for:
    - Trend following strategies (breakout trades)
    - Identifying overbought/oversold conditions
    - Setting trailing stop-loss levels
    - Measuring market volatility

Example:
    Run the test directly::

        python test_108_keltner_channel_strategy.py

    Or use pytest::

        pytest tests/strategies/108_keltner_channel_strategy.py -v

class KeltnerChannelIndicator(bt.Indicator):
    """Keltner Channel volatility-based indicator.

    The Keltner Channel is a technical analysis indicator that consists of
    three lines designed to capture price volatility and trend direction.
    Unlike Bollinger Bands which use standard deviation, Keltner Channels
    use the Average True Range (ATR) to determine band width, making them
    more responsive to price gaps and limit moves.

    Construction:
        - Middle Line (mid): Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of close prices
        - Upper Band (top): EMA + (ATR × multiplier)
        - Lower Band (bot): EMA - (ATR × multiplier)

    Interpretation:
        - Price above upper band: Strong bullish momentum, potential breakout
        - Price below lower band: Strong bearish momentum, potential breakdown
        - Price between bands: Trading within normal volatility range
        - Expanding bands: Increasing volatility
        - Contracting bands: Decreasing volatility (potential squeeze)

    Lines:
        mid: Middle line (Exponential Moving Average). Serves as the baseline
            for the channel and represents the average price over the period.
        top: Upper band (mid + atr_mult * ATR). Acts as dynamic resistance
            and breakout level for long entries.
        bot: Lower band (mid - atr_mult * ATR). Acts as dynamic support
            and breakdown level for short entries.

    Parameters:
        period (int): Period for the EMA middle line calculation (default: 20).
            Shorter periods make the channel more responsive to price changes.
        atr_mult (float): Multiplier for ATR band width (default: 2.0).
            Higher values create wider bands, fewer signals.
            Lower values create narrower bands, more signals.
        atr_period (int): Period for ATR calculation (default: 14).
            Measures market volatility over this lookback period.

    Example:
        >>> # Create Keltner Channel with custom parameters
        >>> kc = KeltnerChannelIndicator(self.data, period=20, atr_mult=2.5)
        >>> # Access channel values
        >>> print(f"Upper: {kc.top[0]}, Mid: {kc.mid[0]}, Lower: {kc.bot[0]}")

    Note:
        The Keltner Channel is particularly effective in trending markets
        and for identifying breakout opportunities. Consider combining with
        other indicators for confirmation in ranging markets.

class KeltnerChannelStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    """Keltner Channel breakout trading strategy.

    This strategy implements a trend-following system based on Keltner Channel
    breakouts. It takes long positions when price breaks above the upper band,
    indicating strong bullish momentum and the start of a potential uptrend.
    Positions are closed when price falls back below the middle line (EMA),
    suggesting the trend has weakened or reversed.

    Trading Logic:
        The strategy captures breakout moves by entering when price shows
        sufficient strength to break through the upper Keltner Channel band.
        This breakout often precedes significant uptrends as it indicates
        buying pressure strong enough to overcome normal volatility ranges.

    Entry Conditions:
        - No current position exists
        - Price closes above the upper Keltner Channel band
        - This indicates strong bullish momentum and potential trend start

    Exit Conditions:
        - Currently in long position
        - Price closes below the middle line (EMA)
        - This suggests trend weakening or reversal

    Parameters:
        stake (int): Number of shares/units per trade (default: 10).
            Controls position sizing and risk per trade.
        period (int): Period for the EMA middle line (default: 20).
            Shorter periods create more responsive channels, more signals.
        atr_mult (float): Multiplier for ATR band width (default: 2.0).
            Higher values create wider bands, requiring stronger moves for breakout.
            Lower values create narrower bands, generating more signals.

    Attributes:
        kc (KeltnerChannelIndicator): The Keltner Channel indicator instance
            providing the upper, middle, and lower band values.
        order (bt.Order): Reference to the currently pending order, or None
            if no order is pending.
        bar_num (int): Counter tracking the total number of bars processed
            during the backtest.
        buy_count (int): Total number of buy orders executed.
        sell_count (int): Total number of sell orders executed.

    Example:
        >>> cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
        >>> cerebro.addstrategy(KeltnerChannelStrategy, stake=100, period=20, atr_mult=2.5)
        >>> results = cerebro.run()

    Note:
        This strategy performs best in markets with clear trending behavior
        and can experience whipsaws in ranging or choppy markets. Consider
        adding filters like ADX for trend strength or volume confirmation
        to reduce false breakouts.
