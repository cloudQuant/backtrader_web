I can see this is a prompt file in Chinese for generating trading strategy documentation. However, the HTML file path it references shows a download failure (`{"message": "下载失败", "success": false}`).

The prompt is asking me to:
1. Read an HTML file about "Supervised Learning for Document Classification with Scikit-Learn"
2. Generate a detailed Markdown strategy document with 10 specific sections
3. Classify the strategy type based on keywords

**The issue:** The HTML file download failed, so there's no content to process.

**What would you like me to do?**

1. **Try to read the HTML file directly** from `/home/yun/Downloads/论文/论文/003_Supervised Learning for Document Classification with Scikit-Learn [Quant Start] (1).html` to see if it exists locally?

2. **Create a strategy documentation template** based on the requirements in this prompt that you can use for other strategies?

3. **Help fix the download issue** if you're trying to fetch this from a web source?

4. **Something else** - please let me know what you need!
