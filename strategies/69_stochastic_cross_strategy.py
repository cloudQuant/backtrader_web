"""Test module for Stochastic Cross Strategy.

This module tests a quantitative trading strategy that combines Simple Moving
Average (SMA) trend indicators with Stochastic oscillator signals to generate
buy and sell signals. The strategy enters long positions when the short-term
MA is above the long-term MA and the Stochastic indicator is oversold, and
exits when the short-term MA is below the long-term MA and the Stochastic
indicator is overbought.

Example:
    To run the test directly::

        python tests/strategies/69_stochastic_cross_strategy.py

    Or using pytest::

        pytest tests/strategies/69_stochastic_cross_strategy.py -v

class StochasticCrossStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    """A quantitative trading strategy based on Stochastic oscillator crossover.

    This strategy combines Simple Moving Average (SMA) trend indicators with
    Stochastic oscillator signals to generate buy and sell signals. The strategy
    aims to capture trend reversals by entering positions when the market is
    oversold in an uptrend and exiting when overbought in a downtrend.

    Trading Logic:
        - Buy Signal: Short-term MA > Long-term MA AND Stochastic %K < oversold threshold (20)
        - Sell Signal: Short-term MA < Long-term MA AND Stochastic %K > overbought threshold (80)

    The strategy ensures only one position is active at a time by tracking
    the last operation and preventing duplicate signals.

    Attributes:
        dataclose: Reference to the close price line of the primary data feed.
        ma1: Short-term Simple Moving Average indicator (default 14-period).
        ma2: Long-term Simple Moving Average indicator (default 30-period).
        stoch: Stochastic oscillator indicator providing %K and %D lines.
        order: Reference to the currently pending order, or None if no order is active.
        last_operation: String tracking the last executed operation ("BUY" or "SELL").
        bar_num: Integer counter for the number of bars processed during the backtest.
        buy_count: Integer counter for the total number of buy orders executed.
        sell_count: Integer counter for the total number of sell orders executed.

    Parameters:
        stake: Number of shares/contracts per trade (default: 10).
        ma1: Period for the short-term SMA (default: 14).
        ma2: Period for the long-term SMA (default: 30).
        stoch_period: Period for the Stochastic oscillator calculation (default: 14).
        oversold: Stochastic threshold below which is considered oversold (default: 20).
        overbought: Stochastic threshold above which is considered overbought (default: 80).
