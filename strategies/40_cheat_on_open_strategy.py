"""Test module for Cheat On Open strategy functionality.

This module tests the cheat-on-open feature in backtrader, which allows orders
to be executed at the opening price of the next bar rather than the closing
price. This is particularly useful for simulating realistic order execution
where decisions are made after the close but executed at the next open.

Understanding Cheat On Open:
    By default, backtrader executes orders at the close of the current bar
    when the strategy's next() method is called. With cheat_on_open=True:
    - next() is called BEFORE the bar opens (with previous bar's data)
    - Orders can be executed at the OPEN of the current bar
    - Simulates overnight decisions and market-on-open orders

Key Benefits:
    - More realistic simulation of end-of-day analysis and next-day execution
    - Allows strategies based on after-close calculations
    - Prevents look-ahead bias in order execution
    - Better models real-world trading where decisions are made after close

Use Cases:
    - End-of-day strategies that execute at market open next day
    - Strategies analyzing closing patterns to trade next open
    - Gap trading strategies
    - Overnight holding strategies

Trade-offs:
    - Execution price uncertainty (open may differ from close)
    - Gap risk (overnight news can cause significant price changes)
    - Slippage may be higher at market open

class CheatOnOpenStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    """Dual moving average crossover strategy with cheat-on-open execution.

    This strategy implements a classic dual moving average crossover system and
    demonstrates the use of the cheat-on-open feature to execute orders at the
    opening price of the next bar instead of the closing price. This more
    realistically simulates end-of-day analysis and next-day trading decisions.

    Strategy Logic:
        The strategy uses two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) with different periods:
        - Short SMA (fast): Responds quickly to price changes
        - Long SMA (slow): Smooths out noise, shows overall trend

        Crossover signals:
        - Bullish crossover (short crosses above long): Buy signal
        - Bearish crossover (short crosses below long): Exit signal

    Cheat On Open Behavior:
        With cheat_on_open=True in Cerebro:
        - Strategy's next() method is called BEFORE the bar opens
        - Can access previous bar's indicators for decision making
        - Orders placed in next() execute at the CURRENT bar's open price
        - Simulates overnight decisions and market-on-open orders

    Parameters:
        periods (list): List of two integers specifying SMA periods.
            First element is fast SMA period (default: 10).
            Second element is slow SMA period (default: 30).
            Shorter fast period = more signals, more noise.
            Longer slow period = smoother trend, slower signals.

    Attributes:
        signal (bt.ind.CrossOver): Crossover indicator detecting when fast SMA
            crosses above/below slow SMA. Returns positive on bullish crossover,
            negative on bearish crossover.
        order (bt.Order): Reference to the currently pending order, or None.
        bar_num (int): Counter tracking total bars processed during backtest.
        buy_count (int): Total number of buy orders executed.
        sell_count (int): Total number of sell orders executed.
        win_count (int): Number of profitable closed trades.
        loss_count (int): Number of unprofitable closed trades.
        sum_profit (float): Total profit/loss across all closed trades.

    Example:
        >>> cerebro = bt.Cerebro(cheat_on_open=True)
        >>> cerebro.addstrategy(CheatOnOpenStrategy, periods=[10, 30])
        >>> results = cerebro.run()

    Note:
        The cheat-on-open feature is particularly useful for strategies that:
        - Analyze end-of-day data and trade next day
        - Want to avoid look-ahead bias in execution
        - Simulate realistic market-on-open order execution

    This test validates the cheat_on_open functionality by running a complete
    backtest with dual moving average crossover strategy. The key aspect being
    tested is that orders execute at the opening price rather than closing price,
    which should produce specific, consistent performance metrics.

    Test Procedure:
        1. Initialize Cerebro with cheat_on_open=True enabled
        2. Set initial capital to $100,000
        3. Load historical daily data (2005-2006)
        4. Add CheatOnOpenStrategy with default SMA periods [10, 30]
        5. Set fixed position size of 10 shares per trade
        6. Attach performance analyzers
        7. Execute backtest and validate results

    Expected Results:
        - Total bars processed: 482
        - Final portfolio value: ~104966.80
        - Sharpe Ratio: ~11.65 (very high due to specific data period)
        - Annual Return: ~2.41%
        - Maximum Drawdown: ~3.43%

    The cheat-on-open feature should produce results distinct from regular
    execution because orders fill at open prices rather than close prices,
    affecting entry and exit prices for all trades.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any performance metric deviates from expected
            values within specified tolerance levels.

        Tolerance levels: 0.01 for final_value (accounting for rounding),
