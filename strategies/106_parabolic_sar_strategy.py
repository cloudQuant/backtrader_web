"""Test module for Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator strategy.

This module implements and tests a trading strategy based on the Parabolic SAR
indicator, which is a technical analysis method used to determine trend direction
and potential reversals. The Parabolic SAR was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr.
and is particularly useful in trending markets.

Reference:
    strategies_backtrader/SAR (STOP AND REVERSE) METHOD.ipynb

The Parabolic SAR indicator:
    - Uses a series of dots placed above or below price bars
    - Dots below price indicate bullish trend (long position)
    - Dots above price indicate bearish trend (short position)
    - When dots flip from below to above, it generates a sell signal
    - When dots flip from above to below, it generates a buy signal
    - The acceleration factor (af) increases as the trend continues
    - Provides trailing stop-loss levels that adjust dynamically

Example:
    Run the test directly::

        python test_106_parabolic_sar_strategy.py

    Or use pytest::

        pytest tests/strategies/106_parabolic_sar_strategy.py -v

class ParabolicSarStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    """Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator-based trading strategy.

    This strategy implements a trend-following system using the Parabolic SAR
    indicator. The Parabolic SAR is particularly effective in trending markets
    as it provides clear entry and exit signals while also functioning as a
    trailing stop-loss mechanism.

    Trading Logic:
        The strategy uses crossover signals between price and SAR:
        - When price crosses ABOVE SAR from below: Enter long position
        - When price crosses BELOW SAR from above: Exit long position

    Entry Conditions:
        - No current position exists
        - Price closes above the SAR line (bullish signal)

    Exit Conditions:
        - Currently in long position
        - Price closes below the SAR line (bearish signal/reversal)

    Parameters:
        stake (int): Number of shares/units per trade (default: 10).
        af (float): Initial acceleration factor for SAR calculation (default: 0.02).
            The acceleration factor determines how quickly the SAR moves toward price.
            Typical values range from 0.02 to 0.03.
        afmax (float): Maximum acceleration factor (default: 0.2).
            The AF increases each time a new high is made (in uptrend) until it
            reaches this maximum value.

    Attributes:
        sar (bt.indicators.ParabolicSAR): The Parabolic SAR indicator instance
            providing the SAR values for trend identification.
        crossover (bt.indicators.CrossOver): Indicator detecting when price
            crosses above/below the SAR line. Returns positive on bullish
            crossover, negative on bearish crossover.
        order (bt.Order): Reference to the currently pending order. None if
            no order is pending.
        bar_num (int): Counter tracking the total number of bars processed
            during the backtest.
        buy_count (int): Total number of buy orders executed during the
            backtest period.
        sell_count (int): Total number of sell orders executed during the
            backtest period.

    Note:
        The Parabolic SAR is most effective in strong trending markets and
        can produce false signals in ranging or choppy markets. Consider
        combining with other indicators for filtering signals in sideways markets.

    Example:
        >>> cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
